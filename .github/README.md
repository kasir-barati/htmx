# Todo

A simple Fullstack app written in ExpressJS + htmx. It is really fun to work with htmx. **I also wrote a dev.to post about it. You can read it [here](https://dev.to/kasir-barati/htmx-and-expressjs-36dk)**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> But it also has its own downside. Like when your backend should serve other clients other than htmx, then what? because as you can see in my code I am returning HTML as response. But nonetheless it is a very intriguing approach to developing web applications.

## How to run it

1. `cd backend`.
2. `pnpm install`.
3. `pnpm dev`.
4. You can open one of the following files in your browser then:
   - `frontend/index.html`.
   - `frontend/register.html`.

Now you should be good to go, try to remove, add or check some of the todos ;).
